Q. “Algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Algorithm Y” , what does this mean?
Ans. X will always be a better choice for large inputs

Q. What will be the Time Complexity of the following code in terms of ‘n’ ?

Note : Assume k to be a constant value

for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
   for(int j = 1 ; j < k; j++)

      cout << (i + j ) << endl;
     }
 }
Ans. O(n)

Q. What is the time and space complexity of the following code:

   int a = 0, b = 0;    
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        a = a + 1;  
    }
    for (j = 0; j < M; j++) {
        b = b + 1;
    }
Ans. O(N+M) time, O(1) space

Q. Consider the following for loops:

 A) for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
 B) for(i = 0; i < n; i += 2)
 C) for(i = 1; i < n; i *= 2)
 D) for(i = n; i > -1; i /= 2)
Which loop will execute fastest?
Ans. C

Q. Given the time complexities of different functions, arrange them in increasing order:

  f1(n) = 2^n
  f2(n) = n^(5/2)
  f3(n) = nLogn
  f4(n) = n^(Logn)  
Assume n = 10^6.
Ans. f3 < f2 < f4 < f1

Q. Given two 2-d arrays A and B, each array can be stored either in row-major or column-major order in contiguous memory locations.

The time complexity of an algorithm to compute A × B will be?
Ans. independent of the storage scheme

Q. What is the time complexity of the following code ?

  int multiplyRecursive(int m, int n){
    if(n == 1)
        return m;
    return m + multiplyRec(m,  n - 1);  
  }
Ans. O(n)

Q. The recurrence relation capturing the optimal time of the Tower of Hanoi problem with n discs is.

Ans. T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1

Q. What is the time complexity of following code ?

  int sumOfDigits(int n)
  {
    int sum;
    if(n < 10){
        return n;
    }
    sum = (n % 10) + sumOfDigits(n / 10);
    return sum;
   }
Ans. O(logn) (log is to the base 10)

Q. What is the worst case time complexity of the following code :

 /* 
    * V is sorted 
    * V.size() = N
    * The function is initially called as 
       searchNumOccurrence(V, k, 0, N-1)
 */
  int searchNumOccurrence(vector<int> &V, int k, int start, int end) 
   {
      if (start > end) 
           return 0;
      int mid = (start + end) / 2;
      if (V[mid] < k) 
          return searchNumOccurrence(V, k, mid + 1, end);
      if (V[mid] > k) 
           return searchNumOccurrence(V, k, start, mid - 1);

     return searchNumOccurrence(V, k, start, mid - 1) + 1 + searchNumOccurrence(V, k, mid + 1, end);
    }
Ans. O(n)
